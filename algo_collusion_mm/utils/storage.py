        Parameters
        ----------
        objects : list of any or None, defualt=None
            List of Python objects to be saved. Each object may define a `name` attribute,
            which is used as filename. If not provided, the object's Python ID is used instead.

        figure : matplotlib.figure.Figure or None, defualt=None
            If given, the figure will be saved as `PLOT.png` inside the 
            experiment folder.
        info : str or dict or None, default=None
